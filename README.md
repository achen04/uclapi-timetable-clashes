# UCL API Timetable Clashes Project
A web application that checks if the user's desired courses have a clash. Uses the UCL timetable API to draw information on each course.

Note: Please move to the "glitch" branch to view the code. 
      The application can be accessed here: https://uclapi-timetable-clashes.glitch.me/
